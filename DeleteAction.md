The Delete Action in OmniStudioâ€™s Integration Procedure allows you to efficiently delete sObject records from Salesforce using a declarative approach. This feature is particularly useful for managing your Salesforce records without writing code.

## Steps to Configure the Delete Action

### 1. Create a New Integration Procedure
- **Navigate to OmniStudio:** Start by going to the OmniStudio section in Salesforce and selecting Integration Procedures.
- **Create a New Integration Procedure:** Click on New, fill in the Type and Subtype fields, and save your Integration Procedure.

### 2. Add the Delete Action

- **Define the Path to Id:** In the Path to Id field, input the JSON path that corresponds to the record IDs you want to delete.

For example, if your data JSON is structured like this:

```json
{
    "MyObj": {
        "ContactIds": [
            "0037800000LyxyxAAB",
            "0037800000J2ZovAAF"
        ]
    }
}
